                        Even though we have had very hot weather and also very wet and windy weather over the past month the paint has stayed 
                        crisp and fresh with no chipping or fading."

                        When they were delivered, she was amazed at the range of colours. 
                        Really good quality and value for money. I would definitely buy them again."

                        I'd been searching for weeks for a decent set of paints that wouldn't cost me the earth and these have been great to work with. 
                        I will definitely be buying these again! Thank you."
